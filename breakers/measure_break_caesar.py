# Answers
#
# 1) At which length does the breaker become reliable?
#    From 20 letters it's already above 90% with the right table, and by
#    30 letters it's basically always right (100% in my runs). Below that
#    there just isn't enough text for chi-squared to tell the real key
#    apart from the other 25 shifts.

# 2) How much does the wrong language table cost you?
#    It depends on which table is wrong. Using the English table on
#    Spanish text starts off costly for short texts (~35 points worse at
#    20 letters) but that gap almost disappears by 100 letters, so more
#    ciphertext fixes it. Using the Spanish table on English text is
#    worse and doesn't get better with length - it stays wrong a lot of
#    the time even at 100 letters. The Spanish table's letter shape
#    (extra letter, higher A/E weight) just doesn't match English well,
#    so guessing the wrong table isn't equally bad in both directions.
